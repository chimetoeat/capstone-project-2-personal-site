        I am quite the optimist. I like playing games, reading books, watching
        movies, and learning other things I don't know about, like WEB DEVELOPMENT, which I am learning now, again! *LOL*

        <h3>Skills</h3>

        <img src="./assets/images/development.gif" alt="development" />
        <h4>Development</h4>
        <p>Web Development is hard for me, but I want to take this chance to take this seriously and be great at web development.</p>

        <img src="./assets/images/music.gif" alt="development" />
        <h4>Music</h4>
        <p>I just love music and I've been learning instruments.</p>

        <img src="./assets/images/rubiks.gif" alt="development" />
        <h4>Rubik's Cube</h4>
        <p>Solving Rubik's Cube is one of my thing, I could solve a Rubik's Cube in less that 15 seconds.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Hobbies</h3>

        <img src="./assets/images/movies.gif" alt="development" />
        <h4>Movies</h4>
        <p>I have been watching movies since I was a child. 3 Idiots is one of the movies I've been watching again and again.</p>

        <img src="./assets/images/anime.gif" alt="development" />
        <h4>Anime</h4>
        <p>Anime is so cool and it just gets you pumped up when awesome fight scenes are on!</p>

        <img src="./assets/images/games.gif" alt="development" />
        <h4>Games</h4>
        <p>I was addicted to gaming when I got to Senior High School. My friends and I would play for hours and hours until it gets dark.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Others</h3>
        <p>
          <p>
            I am a Christian, even though I have work, I would always have a
            time for God, to thank Him and to praise Him for all He's done to
            me.
          </p>
        </p>

        <p>
          <p>
            There's nothing special about me, I just want to keep learning
            something outside of my knowledge and experience things I haven't
            experienced before. I always help myself to enjoy from time to time
            to keep myself happy.
          </p>
        </p>
        <p>
          <p>
            In my spare time, I would play games, or watch Anime, or Movies or
            read a book, or just keep playing online games till it gets dark
            without myself even noticing it. LOL!
